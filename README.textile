public/cms [this is symlinked so you need to regenerate it on the server/upon new clone]
upload


rm public/index.html 

clear *MYAPP* routes

edit config/database.yml - you need a 'cucumber' env with same settings as test to run features

add the following line to environment.rb (I put under the gems)
eval(File.read("#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/plugins/cms-engine/config/environment.rb"))

git submodule add git@github.com:bluestorm/cms-engine.git vendor/plugins/cms-engine
